Use #mouseDown: or #handlerForMousedown: instead.- Object >> #clone should not be used anymore in favor of #shallowCopy.- Symbol class >> #internCharacter:. There is no need for a character table anymore because all characters are immediate.- Set >> #addNewElement:- String >> #openInWorkspaceWithTitle: in favor of the UI manager interfaceKnown Issues (same as in 5.2 ???)- List filtering in multi-selection lists may break sometimes, i.e. in the TestRunner- Collecting colors via Form >> #collectColors: might lead to unexpected results because the Color black will be treated as transparent color here.- SqueakSSL has no SAN support for all platforms. This can be the reason why https://www.github.com cannot be accessed but https://github.com works.- There can be issues when using interface languages other than English due to automatic translation. This will be addressed in future releases.- You cannot apply a user interface theme from within MVC.- Some core packages depend on Etoys packages in this release. These depenencides will be removed in future releses- The UTF text converters might accept invalid character sequences- On some virtual machines a FloatTest can failCompatibility Notes- The deprecated classes ContextPart, BlockContext, and MethodContext are back but should not be used anymore in favor of Context.- The lookup of literals in code objects is now always thorough.!]style[(32 11 2 3 61 3 21 2 6 8 11 8 10 8 8 8 12 8 6 8 11 9 24 2 8 8 7 55 25 44 8 8 5 9 15 2 7 381 8 95 9 8 9 8 3 9 31 2 5 8 11 8 5 8 6 9 22 2 4 8 7 92 5 9 35 2 7 8 12 8 4 9 25 2 43 8 29 8 5 8 8 8 8 8 27 9 44 2 55 8 10 8 9 9 26 2 5 8 14 9 18 26 7 136 9 60 16 119 22 13 21 155 12 4 33 25 15 127 10 12 13 1 19 76 10 25 23 95 4 4 9 8 3 55 22 24 18 51 9 147 3 214 9 11 19 123 7 30 12 24)b,,i,,b,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,Rcode://BalloonEngine;,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,b,,Rcode://ToolSet class;,,LWebClient Definition;,,Rcode://FileAbstractSelectionDialog;,,Rcode://QEncodingMimeConverter;,,Rcode://Morph>>#handlerForMetaMenu:;,,Rcode://Object >> #shallowCopy;,,Rcode://Symbol class >> #internCharacter:;,,Rcode://#characterTable;,,Rcode://UIManager >> #edit:label:;,,b,,b,,Rcode://TestRunner open;,,Rcode://Form >> #collectColors:;,,Rcode://Color class >> #colorFromPixelValue:depth:;,,Rcode://SqueakSSL;,,Rhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name;,,Rcode://(WebClient httpGet: 'https://www.github.com') explore;,,Rcode://(WebClient httpGet: 'https://github.com') explore;,,Rcode://Project current chooseNaturalLanguage. 42;,,Rcode://MVCProject new enter;,,Rcode://FloatTest>>#testTimesTwoPowerGradualUnderflow;,,b,,Rcode://Context;,,Rcode://CompiledCode;,!
