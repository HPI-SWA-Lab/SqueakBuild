*** Squeak 5.3 Release Notes ***TBD .... ABFTODO: asSimpleSetter, isSimpleSetter (already in trunk?)- clean-up effort (implementors of #cleanUp: and #cleanUp?)Detailed Improvementsin Language, Tools, and the Environment~~~ Core Language ~~~Kernel- ...Collections- Adds Text >> #format:- Fixes #collect:as: for Set into Dictionary- Adds String >> #findFeatures, which is simple analysis of natural language in source code. No word stemming. Interface is similar to #findTokens- Adds Collection >> #any: and Collection >> #take:. Works like #first: for sequenceable collections. #take does not fail if collection is too small.- Adds Collection >> #log2, since it already responds to #ln and #log- Adds Collection >> #isOfSameSizeCheck:, similar to #emptyCheck- When creating a text from a string and runs, check whether the run length matches string length- Definitively abandon SequenceableCollection equality tests based on equal species. Old behaviour can still be obtained through #hasEqualElements: but the default is to not try to support such trans-class equality feature because it is much too complex.- Better performance in some String functions- Better performance in some HashedCollection functions- Better performance in some SequenceableCollection functions- Fixes an endless-loop bug in HtmlReadWriterChronology- ...Compiler- Fixes ifNil:ifNotNil: decompilation- Fixes decompilation of full blocks- Always quote parser error notifications (also in interactive mode) to make syntax highlighting work in tools- Fixes in EncoderForSistaV1- Fixes in HeapEnvironments- ...Traits- ...PackageInfo- Adds convenience messages to look up packages in the package organizer by name~~~ Graphics & Sound ~~~Graphics- Improved implementation of named colors such as Color banana, which speeds up Color >> #name- Fixes in the HTML representation of colors- Adds infix versions for creating rectangles from points around a center- Improved support for virtual displays- Font-size summary now has proper formatting to match the respective font faces- Improved Form implementation to better fit Spur (memory model)Balloon- ...TrueType (Fonts)- ...Sound- ...~~~ Network ~~~Network- For the FileList tool, fixes an endless cycle when listing server directories that miss login credentials.- Better comments in FTPClient- Improves mail-address tokenizationSqueakSSL- ...WebClient- ...XML- ...~~~ System Services & Files ~~~Files- ...Compression- ...Regex- ...System- ...~~~ GUI Frameworks ~~~ST80- ...Morphic- All references to the global variable "World" got replaced with "Project current world"Etoys- ...~~~ Help & Internationalization ~~~GetText- ...Multilingual- Improvements in various text converters- UTF16TextConverter will now take endianness into account when writing the BOM- Fix and unify Unicode data downloadingHelp- ...~~~ Programming Tools ~~~Tools (ToolBuilder, CommandLine, Protocols)- ...Preferences (Browser, Wizard)- ...SUnit- ...Nebraska- ...Services- ...Shout (Syntax Highlighting)- ...~~~ Version Control & Package Management ~~~Installer (VersionNumber, UpdateStream, Squeak-Version)- ...Monticello- ...SqueakMap- ...~~~ Deployment & Misc. ~~~Tests- ...ReleaseBuilder- ...Major Deprecations- Debugging interface in ToolSet changed, which also deprecates some #debug* messages- RunArray >> #addLast:times:- HTTPClient should not be used anymore in favor of WebClient.- StandardFileMenu should not be used anymore in favor of new file dialogs- HashedCollection >> #findElementOrNil: and #fullCheck- Symbol class >> #internCharacter:. There is no need for a character table anymore because all characters are immediate.Known Issues (same as in 5.2 ???)- List filtering in multi-selection lists may break sometimes, i.e. in the TestRunner- Collecting colors via Form >> #collectColors: might lead to unexpected results because the Color black will be treated as transparent color here.- SqueakSSL has no SAN support for all platforms. This can be the reason why https://www.github.com cannot be accessed but https://github.com works.- There can be issues when using interface languages other than English due to automatic translation. This will be addressed in future releases.- You cannot apply a user interface theme from within MVC.- Some core packages depend on Etoys packages in this release. These depenencides will be removed in future releses- The UTF text converters might accept invalid character sequences- On some virtual machines a FloatTest can failCompatibility Notes- The deprecated classes ContextPart, BlockContext, and MethodContext are back but should not be used anymore in favor of Context.- The lookup of literals in code objects is now always thorough.!]style[(32 11 2 122 61 3 21 2 6 8 11 8 16 53 23 124 19 5 20 106 19 51 33 146 22 239 6 40 16 40 22 42 14 2 10 8 8 234 12 8 6 8 11 32 16 36 24 2 8 51 12 18 15 52 14 185 4 51 7 8 16 8 5 9 15 2 7 131 9 39 9 8 9 8 3 9 31 2 5 8 11 8 5 8 6 9 22 2 4 8 7 92 5 9 35 2 7 8 12 165 4 9 25 2 43 8 29 8 5 8 8 8 8 8 27 9 44 2 55 8 10 8 9 9 26 2 5 8 14 9 18 26 7 136 9 60 16 59 33 25 15 48 13 1 19 76 10 25 23 95 4 4 9 8 3 55 22 24 18 51 9 147 3 214 9 11 19 123 7 30 12 24)b,,i,,b,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,Rcode://Text >> #format:;,,Rcode://String >> #findFeatures;,,Rcode://Collection >> #any:;,,Rcode://Collection >> #take:;,,Rcode://Collection >> #log2;,,Rcode://Collection >> #isOfSameSizeCheck:;,,Rcode://SequenceableCollection >> #=;,,LString Definition;,,LHashedCollection Definition;,,LSequenceableCollection Definition;,,LHtmlReadWriter Definition;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,Rcode://PackageOrganizer >> #packageNamed:ifPresent:ifAbsent:;,,bf5cgray;,,i,,Rcode://Color banana explore;,,Rcode://Color >> #name;,,Rcode://Point >> #center:;,,Rcode://Form;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,Rcode://FTPClient;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,i,,bf5cgray;,,i,,i,,b,,Rcode://ToolSet class;,,LWebClient Definition;,,Rcode://FileAbstractSelectionDialog;,,Rcode://Symbol class >> #internCharacter:;,,Rcode://#characterTable;,,b,,b,,Rcode://TestRunner open;,,Rcode://Form >> #collectColors:;,,Rcode://Color class >> #colorFromPixelValue:depth:;,,Rcode://SqueakSSL;,,Rhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name;,,Rcode://(WebClient httpGet: 'https://www.github.com') explore;,,Rcode://(WebClient httpGet: 'https://github.com') explore;,,Rcode://Project current chooseNaturalLanguage. 42;,,Rcode://MVCProject new enter;,,Rcode://FloatTest>>#testTimesTwoPowerGradualUnderflow;,,b,,Rcode://Context;,,Rcode://CompiledCode;,!
